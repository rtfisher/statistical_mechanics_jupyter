By way of comparison, the total number of all the stars in the entire Hubble volume of the observable universe is a _mere_ $\\sim 10^{20}$, and all particles (photons, electrons, protons, neutrons) in the Hubble volume _only_ $\\sim 10^{80}$. Remember that an Avogadro's number of H is just 1 gram, about the hydrogen content of a large spoonful of H$_2$O.

The full number of accessible states for $N_A$ spins, $10^{10^{23} }$, is such a Brobdingnagian quantity that it almost defies intuition. If you were just to write out every zero in it in 12 point font starting near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the full number would extend 10 kiloparsecs -- clear past the solar galactocentric radius, and out into the dim recesses of the Milky Way Halo. \n",

The underlying laws of physics (either Newton's and Maxwell's laws in the classical realm, or Schrödinger's equation in the quantum regime) are fully reversible, and there is always a small extremely remote chance for the system to return to its initial state. Yet, because the probabilities involved are so fantastically small, the timescales required for the system to recur to an initial, low entropy state vastly exceed the age of the universe.
